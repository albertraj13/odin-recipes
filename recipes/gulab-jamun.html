    <h2 class="recipe-h2">Gulab jamun is a popular Indian dessert made with milk solids, sugar, rose water, and cardamom powder.</h2>
    <p class="recipe-p">Gulab jamun (pronounced “goe-laab DJA-moen“) is a well-known and popular Indian dessert made of fried dough balls. A type of dumpling, gulab jamun is soaked in a sweet, sticky syrup. Gulab means ‘rose water’ so, as per tradition, the sugar syrup has a delicate rose flavour. A jamun is an Indian berry with a size and colour comparable to the dough balls, hence the name: Gulab jamun.</p>
    <p class="recipe-p">The origin of gulab jamun lay in Persia and the Mediterranean and, thanks to the introduction of white wheat flour from Central Asia, could now also be made in India. Indian chefs used khoya, a solid milk ‘paste’ that was the result of milk simmering for hours on a low heat. Nowadays, chefs use the much more convenient dried milk powder to make the dough.</p>
    <p class="recipe-p">Gulab jamun is internationally popular and can be found on almost every Indian restaurant menu in the world.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-h4">Ingredients for making Gulab Jamun</h4>
    <ul class="recipe-ul">
        <li>Sugar syrup</li>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Khoya/mawa</li>
        <li>Milk powder</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-h4">Steps to Follow</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4 class="recipe-h4">Make the dough. </h4>
            <p>Mix the wet and dry ingredients separately, then combine them to form a dough. The dough should be soft and smooth, with enough moisture to bind the ingredients. Avoid kneading the dough, as this can make the gulab jamun hard.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="recipe-h4">Make balls.</h4>
            <p>After kneading, cover the dough with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out. Let the dough rest for at least 10 minutes. Then, use light hands to roll the dough into smooth, crack-free balls.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="recipe-h4">Fry the balls. </h4>
            <p>Heat the ghee or oil to the right temperature. Hot ghee or oil will brown the gulab jamun quickly, while low heat will make them too soft. Pinch off small balls of dough and roll them into smooth balls. Fry the balls in batches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="recipe-h4">Soak the gulab jamun. </h4>
            <p>After frying, soak the balls in the sugar syrup for at least 1–2 hours before serving. This allows the jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft and sweet.</p>
